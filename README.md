# Yet-Another-NES-Pong

This was merely a learning exercise for me on the NES. I'd been learning it for a few weeks, before deciding to put my skills to the test-make a simple game.
It's not the most grand version of Pong out there, but it does have a full 2-Player mode in addition to an AI opponent. 
This was all written from scratch in Assembly. While there are other homebrew Pong games on the NES(hence the name), none of those were ever even seen by me.

Code assembles with asm6, or you can just play the game from the ROM provided. On the main menu, the select button switches from one player to two player on the main menu.

Enjoy!
